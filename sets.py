MINI CHALLENGE: PARTY GUEST LIST
-------------------------------
You’re organizing a party! You have two sets of guests.
1. Create two sets:
    invited_friends = {"Alex", "Sam", "Leo", "Nina"}
    rsvped = {"Nina", "Sam", "Jordan"}
2. Print:
    Everyone who was invited (union)
    Everyone who said they’re coming (rsvped)
    Who hasn’t replied yet (difference)
3. Add two new names to invited_friends.
4. One of the people canceled — remove them from rsvped.
5. Print how many total confirmed guests are attending.
6.Check if "Leo" is still coming — print a message depending on the result.
